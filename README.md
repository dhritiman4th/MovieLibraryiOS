# MovieLibraryiOS
Hi Guys, I am Dhritiman and in this repository, I have created a simple Movie library app using SwiftUI. I hope you will learn something new from this project.

The server side project which I created to expose all apis is @https://github.com/dhritiman4th/MovieLibraryServerSide which I developed using Swift, Vapor, and Heroku. Please check this too.
